There are three workstations available in the lab: `ayan`, `echo`, and `manu`. To access them, you can either use VSCode or SSH.

# GPUs

| Name | OS | RAM | GPU |
| :---: | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `ayan` | Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS | 126 GB | 4 x NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti (11 GB) |
| `echo` | Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS | 252 GB | 4 x NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24 GB) |
| `manu` | Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS | 126 GB | 4 x NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti (11 GB) |

You can check the status of the GPUs using `nvidia-smi`. For very long jobs please use SCC.

# Remote access via SSH
You can get a remote shell on `echo`  using

```bash
$ ssh user@echo.bumc.bu.edu
```

Where `user` is your BU username. You can also authenticate using an SSH key, so you won't have to enter your password as often: if you don't already have an SSH key pair, generate it 
```bash
$ ssh-keygen
```
then copy your publick key to the workstation
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@echo.bumc.bu.edu
```

You are now able to login without password.
