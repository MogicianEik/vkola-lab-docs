This site is a Quarto website. 

To learn more about working with Quarto websites see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites)

To link to another page, use markdown syntax. For example `[this link](practical/workstations.qmd)` points to the page about the workstations: [this link](practical/workstations.qmd).

To contribute, you have a few options:

1. For small changes, click the "Edit this page" link on the right of the page you want to change. It will redirect you to a markdown editor on GitHub.
2. You can also clone the repo [`vkola-lab-docs`](https://github.com/vkola-lab/vkola-lab-docs), edit the relevant markdown files and commit to the `main` branch. The website will be automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions.

# Creating a new page
Create a new `.qmd` file and make sure to include the YAML front matter. For example, this page starts with 
```

title: "Contribute to this website"
author: "Matteo Bellitti"
date: last-modified
published-title: "Last Updated"
---
```
Make sure to only change the `title` and `author` fields. Then write the rest of the document in markdown. See [markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) on Quarto's website for a quick introduction.

The `title` field is used to generate the sidebar.  Sub-directories will create sections and will be automatically titled based on the directory name (including adding capitalization and substituting spaces for dashes and underscores). 

# Quarto and VS Code
There is a VSCode extension that makes editing Quarto documents easier. See also the Quarto [documentation about VSCode integration](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html)
