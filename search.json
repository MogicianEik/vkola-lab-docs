It will redirect you to a markdown editor on GitHub.\nYou can also clone the repo vkola-lab-docs, edit the relevant markdown files and commit to the main branch. The website will be automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions.\n\n\nCreating a new page\nCreate a new .qmd file and make sure to include the YAML front matter. For example, this page starts with\n---\ntitle: \"Contribute to this website\"\nauthor: \"Matteo Bellitti\"\ndate: last-modified\npublished-title: \"Last Updated\"\n---\nMake sure to only change the title and author fields. Then write the rest of the document in markdown. See markdown basics on Quarto’s website for a quick introduction.\nThe title field is used to generate the sidebar. Sub-directories will create sections and will be automatically titled based on the directory name (including adding capitalization and substituting spaces for dashes and underscores).\n\n\nQuarto and VS Code\nThere is a VSCode extension that makes editing Quarto documents easier. See also the Quarto documentation about VSCode integration",
