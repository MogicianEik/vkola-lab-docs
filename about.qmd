# Navigation Sidebar
The sidebar is automatically generated from the available documents. 

1. Navigation item titles will be read from the title field of documents.
2. Sub-directories will create sections and will be automatically titled based on the directory name (including adding capitalization and substituting spaces for dashes and underscores). Use an index.qmd in the directory to provide an explicit title if you donâ€™t like the automatic one.
3. Order is alphabetical (by filename) unless a numeric order field is provided in document metadata.

# Quarto and VS Code
There is a VSCode extension that makes editing Quarto documents easier. See also the Quarto [documentation about VSCode integration](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html)
