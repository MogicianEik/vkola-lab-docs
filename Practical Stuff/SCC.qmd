> "The Boston University [Shared Computing Cluster](https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/computing-resources/scc/) (SCC) is a heterogeneous Linux cluster [...] suitable for high-performance computing." 

In practice, you should run your code on SCC if you

1. Need to access one of the large datasets, and/or 
2. Need a lot of computing power (CPU or GPU)

You should only run on the workstations (or your own device) 

1. For quick prototyping 
2. If your analysis is light: if you're using tabular data only or doing a regression analysis it's probably fine.
