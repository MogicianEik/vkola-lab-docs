# Data Organization
The datasets are currently being moved to the `/18TB/Datasets` directory on `echo`. The same directory is also accessible as `/18TB_echo/Datasets` from `ayan` and `manu`.

All datasets in the lab should follow the [BIDS standard](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

# Read/Write access
By default everyone has read access to the datasets, but to preven accidents only members of the `dataset-editors` are allowed do write (or delete) from the dataset directory. To check if you are in this group, look at the output of
```
$ groups
```
If you have sudo access and need to add a user to the group, use 
```
$ sudo usermod -aG dataset-editors user
```
